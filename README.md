The app features HubSpot's signature orange branding, modern gradients, and a dashboard-style interface that mirrors the actual 2026 CRM experience. Enjoy your futuristic CRM guide! 🚀Hubspot crm guide 2026Code · HTML Downloadadd in existing codes this:This is a continuation of the previous task: You already created (or will reference) a viable mobile HTML app called "hubspot-crm-guide-2026.html" — a beginner's guide to 2026 CRM Tools focusing on HubSpot. Key existing specs that must remain unchanged:
- Single downloadable .html file (no external dependencies except inline CDNs where necessary for icons/fonts).
- Optimized for mobile: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">, responsive design, touch-friendly.
- Make it PWA-capable: include basic manifest and service worker inline for offline use/installability.
- Body margins: 1% on all sides (margin: 1%).
- Fonts: Small title sizes (h1 ~1.2em, h2 ~1em, etc.), use system fonts or safe web fonts (e.g., -apple-system, BlinkMacOSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif).
- Overall theme/layout: 70% dedicated to 2026 HubSpot CRM style — use HubSpot-inspired colors (primary orange #FF7A59, accents #00A4BD, dark text #33475B, light backgrounds), card-based layouts mimicking HubSpot dashboards, AI-themed icons/elements (e.g., robot/sparkle for Breeze AI), futuristic 2026 touches like AI agents, Breeze, Data Hub, Journey Automation, predictive insights, hybrid human-AI teams.
- Content focus: Beginner-friendly step-by-step guide on how to create, set up, and use HubSpot CRM in 2026 context (contacts, deals, workflows, reports, AI features like Breeze Agents/Assistants, Prospecting Agent, Customer Agent, Smart CRM, Data Hub integration, automation, etc.).
Now, enhance the existing app by adding MORE INTERACTIVE FUNCTIONS inside the same single HTML file. Do not break the previous structure — improve/extend it.
New features to add (prioritize these, implement as many as possible cleanly):
1. Collapsible/accordion sections using pure details/summary or simple JS toggle (for steps/tutorials).
2. Dark mode toggle button (save preference in localStorage).
3. Simple progress tracker: e.g., checkboxes or progress bar for "completed sections" (saved in localStorage).
4. Search/filter bar at top to quickly find sections (JS filter on headings/content).
5. Interactive quiz/checklist at the end of major sections (e.g., "Test your knowledge: multiple choice on Breeze Agents" with score).
6. Favorite/bookmark sections (heart icon, saved in localStorage, show starred list).
7. Copy-to-clipboard buttons for code snippets or key steps (if any code/setup examples).
8. Offline fallback message + basic service worker to cache the page.
9. Navigation menu (hamburger on mobile) with smooth scroll to sections.
10. 2026-specific flair: animated subtle glow on AI-related cards, or simple confetti on quiz completion.
Output format:
- First, a short note: "Here is the enhanced version of hubspot-crm-guide-2026.html with added interactive features. Save this code as hubspot-crm-guide-2026.html and open in any mobile browser."
- Then, the COMPLETE single HTML file code inside a markdown code block (html ... ).
- Do NOT output partial code — always the full, runnable file.
- Keep file size reasonable; use inline styles/scripts, minimal external CDNs only (e.g., Font Awesome for icons if needed).
